# MA243-Geometry-Revision
My own revision on the module Geometry, mainly from example sheets and past papers

This repository will mainly focus on two parts, from support class sheets and past papers. For the support class I will create my own pdf, so no license issues should be addressed.

In week 1's example sheets, there are some new definitions and old linear algebra knowledge to look at.
